"NOTES: 
1 The most recent year for which data on landside annual traffic delay are available is 2005. Annual delay per traveler equals extra travel time for peak-period travel during the year divided by the number of travelers who begin a trip during  the peak period (6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.). These peak-period travel times are compared wih times for free-flow speeds (60 mph on freeways and 35 mph on principal arterials).

2 San Francisco Bay Area ports: Oakland, Redwood City, Richmond, San Francisco, and Stockton.

3 Philadelphia/Delaware River ports: Philadelphia, Paulsboro, Marcus Hook, Camden-Gloucester, Chester, and Wilmington.

4 Virginia ports: Norfolk, Richmond, and Newport News.

5 Columbia River ports: Portland, Longview, Vancouver, and Kalama.",,,,,,,,,,,
