"NOTES: Data include oceangoing vessels 1,000 gross tons and above. Capacity equals dwt multiplied by calls. San Francisco includes Oakland, San Francisco, and other ports. Virginia ports include all Hampton Roads area ports (e.g., Norfolk, Newport News). Los Angeles and Long Beach are counted as one port in this table.

1 All container ports in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The data in this table include only loaded containers in U.S. international maritime activity and cover U.S. imports, exports, and transshipments. Therefore, the trade levels will be greater than those reported from U.S. international trade statistics, which exclude transshipments. The data also exclude military shipments.",,,,,,,,,,,
