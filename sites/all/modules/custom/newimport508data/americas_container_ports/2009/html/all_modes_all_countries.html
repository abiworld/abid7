<h2 style="display:none">Container Entries by All Modes from All Countries</h2>

<p>On a typical day in 2007, more than 70,000
individual container units entered the United States
by ocean vessel, truck, and rail. In 2000, the figure
was about 50,000 units per day.</p>

<p>Overall, there were over 25 million container
entries into the United States by all modes of
transportation in 2007, up 38 percent from nearly
19 million in 2000. In addition to the more than 11
million oceanborne containers used to bring goods
into the United States, over 14 million containers
entered the nation by truck and rail from Canada
and Mexico in 2007 (<a href="table_06.html">table 6</a>). The large number of
containers crossing by land border into the United
States by surface modes reflects the importance
of U.S. trade with two of our top three trading
partners. From 2000 to 2007, the number of truck,
rail, and maritime container units (loaded and unloaded)
crossing into the United States rose by 8
percent, 27 percent, and 94 percent, respectively.</p>
