<h2 style="display:none">Trends in Container Throughput</h2>
<p>Despite the 2008 decline in the nation's
economic activity and international merchandise
exports and imports, the United
States remains the world's largest trading
nation with the world's biggest economy. Today, 1
container in every 10 carrying global trade is bound
for or originates in the United States, accounting
for 10 percent of worldwide container traffic. In
2008, world maritime container traffic (loaded and
empty) was estimated at over 387 million TEUs,
down from 437 million TEUs transported in 2007
(<a href="table_02.html">table 2</a>).</p>

<table width="160" align="right" cellpadding="12">
<tr class="highlight">
  <td class="textbox"><p><i>U.S. container

</table>

<p>Between 1995 and 2008, world container traffic
more than tripled in volume from 137 million TEUs
to 387 million TEUs, growing at an average annual
rate of about 8 percent (table 2). This continued
long-term growth in maritime container freight
reflects sustained U.S. and global economic activity.
During this same period, U.S. total container
traffic more than doubled in volume from 22 million
TEUs in 1995 to an estimated 45 million in 2007,
falling to about 38 million in 2008. From 1995 to
2008, U.S. total TEUs rose at an average annual
rate of 4.2 percent. The primary factors underlying
the long-term growth in U.S. maritime container
traffic are the proportion of merchandise trade
transported in containers; rising trade with Asia-
Pacific trading partners, particularly China; and the
increasing importance of merchandise trade to U.S
economic activity. Looking ahead, the volume of
containers that U.S. seaports handle in the coming
years will mainly be determined by how much
the United States continues to rely on imported
manufactured goods, which countries it trades
with most, and what kinds of products it imports
rather than produces domestically. Rising demand
for foreign manufactured products would mean
super-sized container vessels would carry such
products to the nation's seaports, enabling
continued growth in containerization.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_4">4</a></sup></p>


<p>The United States ranked second in
container traffic in 2007, a position it has
held since China took over the number one
position in 1998. Nonetheless, the United
States remains the leading trading nation,
accounting for 11 percent of total world
merchandise trade in 2007 (<a href="figure_04.html">figure 4</a>). U.S.
total imports ranked first, accounting for
over 14 percent of the global imports in
2007. U.S. total exports accounted for 8
percent of global exports, behind Germany,
the leading exporter (WTO 2008). The
United States also remained the world's
largest economy, accounting for 23 percent
of World GDP in 2008, down slightly from
25 percent in 1995 (table 2).</p>

<p>From 1995 to 2008, the volume of containerized
cargo moving through U.S. seaports
grew at a faster rate, 6 percent, than U.S.
real GDP growth, 3 percent (<a href="figure_05.html">figure 5</a>).
During most of the 1990s, strong growth of
the U.S. economy, rising household wealth
and income in the United States, and
steady consumer demand at home spurred
U.S. international goods trade, which
resulted in greater demands for containerized
freight transportation services.</p>


<p>A comparison of the year-on-year percent
change between U.S.-loaded container
TEUs and real GDP shows a correlation
between the container maritime industry
trends and general economic conditions
(<a href="figure_06.html">figure 6</a>). This comparison shows the
effect that economic cycles have on the
U.S. container trade, as evidenced by
the declines in TEUs during the 2001 and
2008 recessions. As figure 6 shows, the
container trade trend is more volatile than
the GDP trend. However, assuming that
the strong cyclical relationship continues,
when the U.S. economy recovers and the
volume of merchandise imports and exports rebounds, then U.S. container seaports are
likely to see a resurgence of container throughput
at their terminals.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_4"></a><sup>4</sup> Containerization is a form of transportation in
which the size and shape of freight is standardized
through the use of containers to allow fast mechanical
handling of cargo at seaports. It differs sharply from
the labor-intensive and time-consuming break-bulk
method of handling cargo of varying sizes and
shapes.</p>
