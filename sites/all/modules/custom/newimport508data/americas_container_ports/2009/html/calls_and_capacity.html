<h2 style="display:none">Vessel Calls and Capacity</h2>

<p>During the past two decades, the concentration
of maritime container vessel calls at U.S. ports
has shifted as the volume of containerized cargo
handled by the ports has changed. In 2007,
there were nearly 20,000 containership calls at
U.S. seaports, accounting for 31 percent of the
total oceangoing vessel calls made by all vessel
types at U.S. ports.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_10">10</a></sup> The top five container ports
handled over half (57 percent) of these container
vessel calls and 63 percent of the container cargo
capacity (<a href="table_04.html">table 4</a>). Just 2 years before, in 2005, the
top five ports handled 55 percent of the calls and
61 percent of the capacity.</p>

<p>Between 2002 and 2007, the number of vessel
calls at U.S. container ports rose 16 percent, from
about 17,100 to 19,800 calls. By contrast, total
vessel calls grew by 13 percent, from 56,600 to
63,800 calls.</p>

<p>Measured by the average vessel size per call,
U.S. maritime ports also handled larger container
vessels than in the past. The average size (per
call) of container vessels calling at U.S. ports was
nearly 48,000 deadweight tons (dwt) in 2007 (table
4). This is a significant increase from 38,000 dwt in
2000. Increases in vessel calls and containership
capacity affect port operation, port productivity,
and infrastructure requirements needed to accommodate
the mega post-Panamax vessels.
They also affect environmental considerations
and community-impact issues. (See <a href="spotlight_03.html">Spotlight 3</a> on
ports and environmental concerns.)</p>


<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_10"></a><sup>10</sup> Of the remainder, 34 percent were by tankers, 17 percent
by dry-bulk vessels, 10 percent by roll-on/roll-off ships, and 6
percent by general cargo ships.</p>
