<h2 style="display:none">Effects of Drop in Container Throughput</h2>
<p>The consequences of the 2008 decline in container
throughput at the nation's seaports reached
beyond marine ports and terminals, affecting
containership fleet capacity, railroads and commercial
trucks that service the seaports, and the inland
warehouses and distribution centers that provide
logistical support for the entire multimodal freight
supply chain. First, because of the decline in global
demand for containership services, the estimated
number of container vessels idled at seaports
worldwide soared by March 2009 to a record high
of more than 450 ships with a carrying capacity
of 1.4 million TEUs (AXS-Alphaliner 2009). These
idle container vessels accounted for approximately
11 percent of the world containership fleet. The
capacity of idle container vessels worldwide nearly
tripled from the beginning of 2008, when it was estimated
to be about 210 ships and 550,000 TEUs.</p>

<p>Second, with the overall decline in containerized
exports and imports, the number of
intermodal<sup> <a href="#ftnt_2">2</a></sup> shipping containers and truck
trailers transported nationwide on railcars
by the nation's Class I railroads<sup> <a href="#ftnt_3">3</a></sup> in 2008
was 11.5 million units, down 4 percent
from 12 million in 2007 and from a record
high of 12.3 million in 2006. About 60
percent of rail intermodal traffic consists
of merchandise imports and exports (AAR
2009). In 2008, the number of international
intermodal containers moved by rail from
the seaports totaled 7.8 million, a decrease
of 7 percent from 2007 (Intermodal Association
of North America 2008). The
imports arrive on ocean vessels and are
long-hauled by railcars to destinations
across the county, and the exports originate
all across the nation and are headed
for destinations around the world.</p>

<p>In one example of the severity of the
declines, the leading Class I railroad for
handling intermodal shipments from west
coast ports, Union Pacific (UP), reported
that the major economic downturn during
the fourth quarter of 2008 compounded
already declining intermodal volumes experienced
earlier in the year and resulted
in fewer intermodal shipments (Union
Pacific Corp. 2009). UP's intermodal traffic
from west coast intermodal terminals was
1.5 million container units in 2008, down
7 percent from 1.6 million units in 2007.
In particular, at the Intermodal Container
Transfer Facility in Los Angeles, UP's intermodal
traffic dropped 13 percent during
the same period.</p>

<p>There were similar declines in trucking services
in the second half of 2008, resulting
in record lows for overall freight trucking
activity. In December 2008, according to
the American Trucking Association (ATA),
trucking activity nationwide was down
13 percent from December 2007. Trucking
services declined for 6 consecutive
months, from June through December
2008 (ATA 2009).</p>

<p>Nationwide freight activity for all modes,
measured by the Freight Transportation
Services Index (TSI), declined 3.0 percent
in 2008. According to the TSI, this decline
was the third consecutive annual decline
and the largest since 2000 (USDOT RITA
BTS 2009). The freight TSI measures
changes in the output of services provided
by the for-hire freight transportation industries
and consists of data from for-hire
trucking, rail, inland waterways, pipelines,
and air freight.</p>

<p>Third, the slowdown of economic activity
within the United States, the reduction in
consumer spending on foreign goods, and
the decline in demand for freight transportation
services resulted in excess inventory
for certain imported products moved by
ocean vessels, especially foreign automobiles.
By March 2009, the parking lots of
the nation's top auto ports had thousands
of new car imports that could not be moved
out. Auto dealers could not take delivery
of them because of the drop in consumer
demand and the lack of bank credit to
finance their inventories (Leach 2009). The
Port of Baltimore, the top auto-handling
port in the United States, had about 57,000
new cars at its terminals and the port had
to store some at the nearby Baltimore-
Washington International Marshall Airport
(Dennis 2009). Storage of imported autos
at U.S. seaports further reduces demand
for train and truck services to transport
them to dealerships, dampens the market
for third-party logistics services, decreases
overseas car manufacturing, and ultimately
increases the number of ocean vessels
that are idled.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_2"></a><sup>2</sup> As used in this report, the term "intermodal" refers
to the traditional rail and truck combination only. This
involves using rail for the long-haul portion of the
shipment and trucks for the shorter distances at both
ends of the shipment. The term also could be used to
describe shipments transported by multiple modes,
including ocean vessels.</p>

2008 operating revenues exceeding $360 million.</p>
