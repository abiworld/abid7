<h2 style="display:none">Regional Shifts in Port Market Share</h2>
<p>The increased use of oceanborne containers in
transporting U.S. international trade continues
to affect port operations and the distribution of
total maritime trade among U.S. ports. Before the
mid-1980s, when U.S. trade with Pacific Rim Asian
countries was modest, east coast ports handled
the majority of U.S. international maritime trade. As
trade with Asia grew, the east coast ports' share of
the value of trade declined and west coast ports'
share increased (<a href="figure_10.html">figure 10</a>). 
Eventually, west coast
ports surpassed east coast ports in maritime cargo
handled, and this trend has continued to today.
Also during this period, changes in industrial activity
in the Midwest affected the volume and type
of cargo moving through Great Lakes ports. For
example, the relocation of final automobile assembly
plants and companies that produce auto parts
had an impact on manufacturing activities in the
Midwest. With the emergence of automakers and
parts producers in other parts of the United States,
maritime cargo originating in the Midwest and
cargo transport via the Great Lakes dwindled. Gulf
of Mexico ports experienced a modest increase
in their relative share as trade with Latin America
grew.</p>

<p>Over half of U.S. containerized merchandise trade,
measured in terms of TEUs, passes through west
coast ports. In 2007, 55 percent of the containerized 
imports and exports passed through these
ports, up from 42 percent in 1980 (figure 10). West
coast ports as a region grew the fastest during this
period (<a href="figure_11.html">figure 11</a>).</p>

<p>Although west coast ports handled the most
container trade, they also had a larger share of the
oceanborne containerized trade deficit, in terms of
export-import balance, than other regional ports.
Today, west coast ports serve more as import gateways
to the United States than as export gateways
to the rest of the world. In contrast, east coast
ports handle more exports than imports, despite
the decline in their regional market share.</p>

<p>Container trade also affects the pattern of freight
movement within the United States. Nearly all U.S.
oceanborne container trade is transported throughout
the country by either rail carriers, long-haul
truck carriers, or local truck carriers. Some ports
use short-sea shipping as an alternative to transport
goods shorter distances.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_9">9</a></sup> The availability and
efficiency of intermodal transportation in moving
these goods to and from any U.S. port increases
shippers' choices of transportation modes and
port facilities, allowing ports to effectively use their
economies of scale to attract cargo from beyond
their immediate region. The growth in U.S. containerized
cargo shipping is placing pressure on the
nation's transportation network and affects local
traffic congestion and delays in the urban areas
surrounding the major U.S. container ports. (See
<a href="spotlight_01.html">Spotlight 1</a> on landside access to the seaports.)</p>


<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_9"></a><sup>9</sup> Short-sea shipping describes the movement of freight along
coastal waterways (for example, from Long Beach to Portland or from New York/New Jersey to Savannah). It includes the
movement of containers and wet and dry bulk cargoes.</p>
