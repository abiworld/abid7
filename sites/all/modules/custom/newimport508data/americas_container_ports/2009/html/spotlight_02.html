<h2 style="display:none">Spotlight 2: Maritime Security</h2>

<p>Securing maritime cargo globally throughout the entire supply chain remains a security challenge
for shipping lines, vessel owners, and shippers. In 2007 and 2008, the issue of piracy and hijacking
of ocean vessels on the high seas became a major concern, particularly for vessels passing through
the Gulf of Aden on the east coast of Africa. In 2008, more than 120 pirate attacks occurred in the
Gulf of Aden (New York Times 2009). On April 8, 2009, a U.S.-flagged container vessel with 20
American sailors was hijacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia. The vessel's crew later regained
control of the ship. The International Maritime Bureau estimates that between January and April
2009, there were 41 attempted pirate attacks and 6 hijackings in Gulf of Aden (ICC Commercial
Crime Services 2009). Preventing such attacks in the vast open oceans is an enormous challenge
for the international maritime community.</p>

<p>The security of U.S. ports and the goods that pass through them depends on numerous governmental
actors, foreign and domestic, and private-sector entities. Following the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001, attention to maritime trade security increased substantially. Legislation and
related government strategies have proliferated, but significant concerns remain about the overall
security of maritime trade.</p>

<p>Several long-term trends in maritime trade have made it more difficult for U.S. authorities to secure
maritime cargo. In the second half of the 20th century, globalization transformed the nation's
economy. The production of many goods moved to low-cost locations overseas, necessitating an
increase in maritime trade. Containerization, the use of large aluminum or steel containers to ship
freight, aided globalization by reducing the amount of time and labor needed to ship goods and by
reducing cargo damage (OECD 2003). The trend toward just-in-time (JIT) production and inventory
management, in which firms seek to cut costs and improve efficiencies through a build-to-order
strategy that dramatically reduces their inventories, has provided many benefits to shippers, but it
has also presented complex security challenges.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_13">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Because containers make up the largest percentage of inbound maritime cargo traffic, they have
been the focus of security efforts. Containers obscure cargo from plain sight. Because of the high
volume of imported containers handled at U.S. seaports, it is a challenge to attempt to inspect every
container without severely interrupting the flow of trade. Containers, and the items they transport,
often take circuitous routes from origin to destination, not only passing port to port but traveling
inland via rail or truck. An average container makes 17 stops between its origin and final destination.
Tampering with containers-inserting illicit material-is not difficult at most points in the
supply chain (Cohen 2006).</p>

<p>U.S. authorities have taken a multilayered approach that attempts to provide maritime freight
security throughout the international supply chain. This section reviews the current maritime security
system and the difficult challenges the United States faces in providing a completely secured
maritime transportation system.</p>

<h3>Post-9/11 Security Improvements</h3>

<p>The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks dramatically increased public-sector attention to maritime
transportation system security. In fiscal year 2001, federal funding for port security was
approximately $259 million. By fiscal year 2005, it had risen to $1.6 billion, a 700 percent increase
(USDHS CBP 2006).</p>

<p><a href="table_08.html">Table 8</a> summarizes some of the significant maritime security legislation in the post- 9/11 period.
The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) and the Security and Accountability for
Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) are among the most important pieces of legislation. Out of
MTSA, the National Maritime Transportation Security Plan was created to provide a framework for
deterrence of security incidents involving maritime transportation infrastructure and for response
to any that may arise. This plan requires two levels of security planning at the local level, the Area
Maritime Security Plans (AMSP) and the Vessel and Facility Security Plans (VSPs and FSPs,
respectively). AMSPs are developed by the local U.S. Coast Guard sector commander/federal maritime
security coordinator, with input from the area maritime security committees, which include
government officials and other key stakeholders. Facility owners or vessel owners or operators
create VSPs and FSPs. There are eight additional mode-specific security plans that are subsidiaries
of the National Maritime Transportation Security Plan.</p>

<p>Under the SAFE Port Act, the Draft Strategy to Enhance International Supply Chain Security was
produced in July 2007.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_14">14</a></sup> The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (USDHS) is the lead agency
in implementing this strategy. It provides an overarching framework to facilitate the secure flow
of international cargo, provides plans for specific segments of the international supply chain, and
focuses on guidance for the resumption of operations following an all hazards incident.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_15">15</a></sup> The
strategy aims to integrate the many plans and initiatives currently in place in order to secure the
supply chain (USDHS 2007).</p>

<p>USDHS and its partners have programs in place to secure maritime cargo throughout the chain of
custody, from the origination of the cargo through its arrival at a final destination (Frittelli 2002).
<a href="table_09.html">Table 9</a> provides an overview of federal programs to secure the various points in the maritime
supply chain. Each program in this table has a unique responsibility in maritime cargo security and
takes a specific approach to it.</p>

<p>Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary public-private partnership
program in which the private owners of supply chain infrastructure and cargo work with U.S.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to improve the security of the international supply chain. CTPAT
participants are asked to ensure that their own security plans and practices are in compliance
with C-TPAT security criteria and coordinated with their business partners throughout the supply
chain. CBP validates and regularly revalidates an entity's participation in C-TPAT (USDHS 2007).
As of March 2008, C-TPAT had more than 8,200 certified members. C-TPAT members account for
80 percent of the value of goods imported into the United States (USDHS CBP 2008).</p>

<p>The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI), a joint program of USDHS and the U.S. Department of Energy
(USDOE), is implemented by CBP and USDOE. SFI began as a pilot program in which seven
overseas ports participated in scanning all U.S.-bound containers for nuclear or radiological materials.
The SFI pilot phase was intended to help authorities prepare for the scanning of U.S.-bound
containers that will be required in the future (GAO 2008b). In the pilot phase, however, 100 percent
of container cargo was scanned at just three of the seven participating ports: Port Qasim, Karachi,
Pakistan; Puerto Cortes, Honduras; and Southampton, United Kingdom (USDHS CBP 2007a).</p>


<p>SFI builds on the Container Security Initiative (CSI), a CBP program, which works with foreign
governments and cargo and facility owners to target and inspect high-risk cargo at its port of origin.
SFI also builds on the USDOE's Megaports Initiative, which works with partner governments to
scan containers for nuclear or radioactive materials (USDHS CBP 2007b).</p>

<p>In addition to these programs, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began distributing
individual port security grants in 2002. By fiscal year 2005, grants awarded totaled $632 million.
Grants have aided ports in conducting security assessments, enhancing facility or operational
security, and implementing cutting-edge technology (Haveman et al. 2006).</p>

<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_13"></a><sup>13</sup> JIT involves keeping materials on hand for only a few days or sometimes only a few hours of operation.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_14"></a><sup>14</sup> A final version of this strategy is scheduled to be completed by October 2009.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_15"></a><sup>15</sup> An all hazards incident refers to any incident, terrorist or natural disaster, that could affect the maritime transportation system.</p>
