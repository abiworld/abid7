<h2 style="display:none">Introduction</h2>

<p>America's container ports play an important role in handling U.S. merchandise trade
moving to and from distant places around the world. Each year, these seaports
handle exports produced at U.S. factories and farms and imports of goods such as automobiles,
machinery, electronics, apparel, shoes, toys, and food. American households
depend on the nation's container seaports for everyday items, and American businesses
depend on these seaports for facilitating the exchange of merchandise with trading
partners around the world.</p>

<p>During 2008, the volume of maritime freight handled by America's container ports
dropped. U.S. international merchandise trade transported by maritime container vessels
fell sharply toward the end of the year, a decline that continued into 2009. Total U.S.
containerized freight for December 2008 was down 18 percent compared with December
2007 (<a href="table_01.html">table 1</a>). Maritime containerized imports declined 15 percent, and exports fell by
21 percent (JOC PIERS 2009a). This happened as U.S. businesses cut inventories,
manufacturing and construction activities stalled, and Americans cut back on spending as
unemployment rose, home values fell, and investment portfolios shrank.</p>

<p>The year 2008 was exceptionally challenging for the nation's leading container seaports.
After a steady pace at the beginning of the year, by end of 2008, containerized freight
throughput declined for each of the leading ports in the Pacific/west coast, Atlantic/east
coast, and gulf coast regions (table 1). All the major ports saw a decline in December
2008 compared with the same month in the previous year. The nation's two leading container
ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, experienced 13 and 25 percent year-on-year
drops, respectively. Other leading ports saw worse declines in container traffic, with cargo
falling by more than one-third to almost one-half-for example, Seattle fell 38 percent and
Mobile fell 49 percent.</p>

<p>By the end of 2008, U.S. total maritime container traffic at all U.S. ports was estimated at
28.2 million TEUs (see box), a 3 percent drop from the 29 million TEUs in 2007 (table 1).
During 2008, west coast ports had a 5 percent decline in container traffic and gulf coast
ports had a 3 percent decline. East coast ports had a 0.2 percent, or essentially negligible,
increase. Among the nation's top 10 leading container ports, 7 saw declines in their
container cargo throughput in 2008. The two largest declines were Seattle at 16 percent
and Long Beach at 8 percent (table 1 and <a href="figure_01.html">figure 1</a>). Only 3 of the top 10 ports, all on the
east coast, handled slightly more container cargo in 2008 than in 2007-Savannah grew
by 3.6 percent, New York/New Jersey by 1.4 percent, and Norfolk by 1.2 percent. These
east coast ports tend to have a more diversified trade market with Europe, Asia, Latin
America, and South America, unlike the west coast ports, which trade almost exclusively
with the Asia-Pacific market.</p>

<table width="350" align="left" cellpadding="12">
<tr class="highlight">
  <td class="textbox"><p><b>TEU Defined</b>:</p>
<p>The standard measure for counting
containers is the 20-foot equivalent
unit, or TEU. This measure is used to
count containers of various lengths. A
standard 40-foot container is 2 TEUs,
and a 48-foot container equals 2.4
TEUs. It is also used to describe the
capacities of containerships or ports.</p></td>

</table>

<p>Containerized trade between the United
States and the rest of the world fell in 2008
because of the combined influence of
weak domestic consumer demand, which
cut import levels, and the global economic
slowdown, which cut foreign demand for
U.S. exports. During the second half of 2008,
as the U.S. financial crisis began to directly
impact consumer spending, Americans cut
back on their purchase of imported clothes,
automobiles, and other consumer merchandise,
such as toys and flat-panel televisions.
In addition, as the domestic financial crisis deepened and the global recession widened,
overseas trading partners' demand for U.S. goods started to tumble, further weakening
the maritime container market. As a result, declines
occurred in U.S. demand for maritime container
transportation by ocean vessels, cargo-handling
activity at the container ports, and the volume of
intermodal freight moved to and from the ports by
truck and rail.</p>

<p>The declines in maritime container traffic mirrored
the slide in overall U.S. international merchandise
exports and imports transported by all modes of
transportation in 2007 and 2008 and followed the
trend in the national economy as a whole (<a href="figure_01.html">figure
2</a> and <a href="figure_01.html">figure 3</a>). According to the U.S. Department
of Commerce, the primary contributors to the
declines in merchandise exports and imports in the
fourth quarter of 2008 were industrial supplies and
materials; automotive vehicles, parts, and engines;
consumer goods; and foods, feeds, and beverages
(USDOC CB BEA 2009). When adjusted for inflation,
the value of merchandise exports in the fourth
quarter of 2008 dropped 34 percent compared with
that of the third quarter. The value of merchandise
imports dropped 19 percent (figure 3).</p>

<p>Trends in container shipping are directly related
to patterns in overall international trade, which is
a primary contributing factor in the nation's economic
growth. For example, real gross domestic
product (GDP)-the output of goods and services
produced by labor and property located in the
United States-decreased at an annual rate of
6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 (i.e., from
the third quarter to the fourth quarter). In the third
quarter, real GDP decreased 0.5 percent (USDOC
BEA 2009). The slowdown in real GDP primarily
refl ected a sharp decline in personal consumption
expenditure, the downturn in exports and
imports, and a decline in state and local government
spending.</p>

<p>Declines in economic activity and drops in exports
and imports result in reduced demand for freight
transportation services by all modes of transportation.
However, because the majority of U.S.
overseas merchandise trade (over 66 percent by
value and 99 percent by weight) moves by ocean
vessel (USDOC CB 2009), the nation's container
ports felt the crunch immediately, but the effects
were not limited to the seaports.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF DROP IN CONTAINER THROUGHPUT</h3>

<p>The consequences of the 2008 decline in container
throughput at the nation's seaports reached
beyond marine ports and terminals, affecting
containership fleet capacity, railroads and commercial
trucks that service the seaports, and the inland
warehouses and distribution centers that provide
logistical support for the entire multimodal freight
supply chain. First, because of the decline in global
demand for containership services, the estimated
number of container vessels idled at seaports
worldwide soared by March 2009 to a record high
of more than 450 ships with a carrying capacity
of 1.4 million TEUs (AXS-Alphaliner 2009). These
idle container vessels accounted for approximately
11 percent of the world containership fleet. The
capacity of idle container vessels worldwide nearly
tripled from the beginning of 2008, when it was estimated
to be about 210 ships and 550,000 TEUs.</p>

<p>Second, with the overall decline in containerized
exports and imports, the number of
intermodal<sup> <a href="#ftnt_2">2</a></sup> shipping containers and truck
trailers transported nationwide on railcars
by the nation's Class I railroads<sup> <a href="#ftnt_3">3</a></sup> in 2008
was 11.5 million units, down 4 percent
from 12 million in 2007 and from a record
high of 12.3 million in 2006. About 60
percent of rail intermodal traffic consists
of merchandise imports and exports (AAR
2009). In 2008, the number of international
intermodal containers moved by rail from
the seaports totaled 7.8 million, a decrease
of 7 percent from 2007 (Intermodal Association
of North America 2008). The
imports arrive on ocean vessels and are
long-hauled by railcars to destinations
across the county, and the exports originate
all across the nation and are headed
for destinations around the world.</p>

<p>In one example of the severity of the
declines, the leading Class I railroad for
handling intermodal shipments from west
coast ports, Union Pacific (UP), reported
that the major economic downturn during
the fourth quarter of 2008 compounded
already declining intermodal volumes experienced
earlier in the year and resulted
in fewer intermodal shipments (Union
Pacific Corp. 2009). UP's intermodal traffic
from west coast intermodal terminals was
1.5 million container units in 2008, down
7 percent from 1.6 million units in 2007.
In particular, at the Intermodal Container
Transfer Facility in Los Angeles, UP's intermodal
traffic dropped 13 percent during
the same period.</p>

<p>There were similar declines in trucking services
in the second half of 2008, resulting
in record lows for overall freight trucking
activity. In December 2008, according to
the American Trucking Association (ATA),
trucking activity nationwide was down
13 percent from December 2007. Trucking
services declined for 6 consecutive
months, from June through December
2008 (ATA 2009).</p>

<p>Nationwide freight activity for all modes,
measured by the Freight Transportation
Services Index (TSI), declined 3.0 percent
in 2008. According to the TSI, this decline
was the third consecutive annual decline
and the largest since 2000 (USDOT RITA
BTS 2009). The freight TSI measures
changes in the output of services provided
by the for-hire freight transportation industries
and consists of data from for-hire
trucking, rail, inland waterways, pipelines,
and air freight.</p>

  <td class="textbox"><p><i>Globally, 1
maritime
container in

bound to or

the United

</tr>
</table>

<p>Third, the slowdown of economic activity
within the United States, the reduction in
consumer spending on foreign goods, and
the decline in demand for freight transportation
services resulted in excess inventory
for certain imported products moved by
ocean vessels, especially foreign automobiles.
By March 2009, the parking lots of
the nation's top auto ports had thousands
of new car imports that could not be moved
out. Auto dealers could not take delivery
of them because of the drop in consumer
demand and the lack of bank credit to
fi nance their inventories (Leach 2009). The
Port of Baltimore, the top auto-handling
port in the United States, had about 57,000
new cars at its terminals and the port had
to store some at the nearby Baltimore-
Washington International Marshall Airport
(Dennis 2009). Storage of imported autos
at U.S. seaports further reduces demand
for train and truck services to transport
them to dealerships, dampens the market
for third-party logistics services, decreases
overseas car manufacturing, and ultimately
increases the number of ocean vessels
that are idled.</p>

<h3>TRENDS IN CONTAINER THROUGHPUT</h3>

<p>Despite the 2008 decline in the nation's
economic activity and international merchandise
exports and imports, the United
States remains the world's largest trading
nation with the world's biggest economy. Today, 1
container in every 10 carrying global trade is bound
for or originates in the United States, accounting
for 10 percent of worldwide container traffic. In
2008, world maritime container traffic (loaded and
empty) was estimated at over 387 million TEUs,
down from 437 million TEUs transported in 2007
(<a href="table_02.html">table 2</a>).</p>

<table width="160" align="right" cellpadding="12">
<tr class="highlight">
  <td class="textbox"><p><i>U.S. container
traffic doubled
over the past
decade, and
the growth
trend is
expected to
continue.</i></p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Between 1995 and 2008, world container traffic
more than tripled in volume from 137 million TEUs
to 387 million TEUs, growing at an average annual
rate of about 8 percent (table 2). This continued
long-term growth in maritime container freight
reflects sustained U.S. and global economic activity.
During this same period, U.S. total container
traffic more than doubled in volume from 22 million
TEUs in 1995 to an estimated 45 million in 2007,
falling to about 38 million in 2008. From 1995 to
2008, U.S. total TEUs rose at an average annual
rate of 4.2 percent. The primary factors underlying
the long-term growth in U.S. maritime container
traffic are the proportion of merchandise trade
transported in containers; rising trade with Asia-
Pacific trading partners, particularly China; and the
increasing importance of merchandise trade to U.S
economic activity. Looking ahead, the volume of
containers that U.S. seaports handle in the coming
years will mainly be determined by how much
the United States continues to rely on imported
manufactured goods, which countries it trades
with most, and what kinds of products it imports
rather than produces domestically. Rising demand
for foreign manufactured products would mean
super-sized container vessels would carry such
products to the nation's seaports, enabling
continued growth in containerization.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_4">4</a></sup></p>


<p>The United States ranked second in
container traffic in 2007, a position it has
held since China took over the number one
position in 1998. Nonetheless, the United
States remains the leading trading nation,
accounting for 11 percent of total world
merchandise trade in 2007 (<a href="figure_04.html">figure 4</a>). U.S.
total imports ranked first, accounting for
over 14 percent of the global imports in
2007. U.S. total exports accounted for 8
percent of global exports, behind Germany,
the leading exporter (WTO 2008). The
United States also remained the world's
largest economy, accounting for 23 percent
of World GDP in 2008, down slightly from
25 percent in 1995 (table 2).</p>

<p>From 1995 to 2008, the volume of containerized
cargo moving through U.S. seaports
grew at a faster rate, 6 percent, than U.S.
real GDP growth, 3 percent (<a href="figure_05.html">figure 5</a>).
During most of the 1990s, strong growth of
the U.S. economy, rising household wealth
and income in the United States, and
steady consumer demand at home spurred
U.S. international goods trade, which
resulted in greater demands for containerized
freight transportation services.</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="12">
  <tr class="highlight">
    <td id="subh111" class="textbox"><p><b>BOX 1<br>
Repositioning of Empty Containers</b></p>

<p>A broad challenge facing the U.S. maritime industry is the
repositioning of empty containers after they have been emptied of
the goods they transported to the United States. During the past
20 years, as merchandise trade between the United States and
its trading partners-particularly Asia-Pacific Rim countries-
mushroomed and the trade imbalance grew, the number of empty
containers idling in the United States increased. In general, the
larger the trade imbalance, the greater the need to reposition
empty containers for shippers to use for exports.</p>

<p>Although containers are designed to be reused (with new cargo
loaded for a new location soon after the original cargo is off-loaded),
in many cases the cost of transporting an empty container to
a place where it can be reloaded is higher than the container is
worth, particularly when empty containers must be transported
from inland locations to U.S. shippers or overseas.</p>

<p>In 1997, the difference between TEUs of U.S. containerized
imports and exports was about 715,000. By 2006, the difference
had reached a record high of nearly 10 million TEUs. In 2008,
it was about 6 million TEUs. These large numbers illustrate the
magnitude of the challenge of handling idle containers.</p>

<p>Empty containers are stored near seaports and inland intermodal
transfer locations. Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York/New
Jersey are the three largest port markets where leasing companies
and shipping lines store empty containers, and Chicago, Dallas,
and Memphis are notable storage locations for empty containers
inland (Mongelluzzo 2008). In 2008, the nation's top container
port, the Port of Los Angeles, handled about 1.9 million TEUs of
empty export containers, accounting for 51 percent of the total
outbound export TEUs for the port.</p>	</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A comparison of the year-on-year percent
change between U.S.-loaded container
TEUs and real GDP shows a correlation
between the container maritime industry
trends and general economic conditions
(<a href="figure_06.html">figure 6</a>). This comparison shows the
effect that economic cycles have on the
U.S. container trade, as evidenced by
the declines in TEUs during the 2001 and
2008 recessions. As figure 6 shows, the
container trade trend is more volatile than
the GDP trend. However, assuming that
the strong cyclical relationship continues,
when the U.S. economy recovers and the
volume of merchandise imports and exports rebounds, then U.S. container seaports are
likely to see a resurgence of container throughput
at their terminals.</p>

<h3>GATEWAYS FOR INBOUND AND OUTBOUND TRAFFIC</h3>

<p>While America's container seaports serve as
gateways for both merchandise imports and
exports, overall they handle more TEUs of imports
than exports. In 2008, the U.S. defi cit in maritime
container traffic-the gap between exports and
imports-narrowed to 6 million TEUs as maritime
container imports fell 8 percent and exports grew
6 percent (<a href="figure_07.html">figure 7</a>). This marked the second
year in a row that the deficit fell following record
high imports in 2006. In 2007 and 2008, although
the United States exported less abroad than it
imported, imports declined steeply because of the
economic slowdown at home. Exports grew
at a modest pace.</p>

<p>Before 1998, the defi cit of U.S. international
container traffic was less than 1 million
TEUs per year, but by 2008, this gap had
signifi cantly widened, with imports accounting
for a larger share of the total container
traffic (figure 7). In 2008, maritime container
imports passing through U.S. seaports
accounted for 61 percent of total container
traffic, a sizeable increase from 51 percent
in 1995. However, container exports
handled by the ports seem to be rebounding,
reaching 39 percent of total container
traffic in 2008, an increase from a low of 33
percent in 2005. A likely factor for the surge
in exports during 2007 and 2008 is the fall of
the U.S. dollar relative to the European euro
and other currencies. During this period, as
the dollar fell against the euro, American
goods became more affordable overseas.
This contributed to the rise in maritime
container exports. A stronger dollar provides
Americans with greater purchasing power
and results in more goods being imported,
while a weaker dollar leads to foreign buyers
purchasing more U.S. products.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_5">5</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="figure_08.html">Figure 8</a> shows the location of the nation's
top 25 maritime container ports for U.S.
international containerized exports and
imports in 2008. The top three container port
gateways were Los Angeles, Long Beach,
and New York/New Jersey. The containerized
exports and imports handled by these
leading ports serve the international trade needs
of every state, both coastal states with seaports as
well as landlocked states that depend on seaports
for their merchandise trade export and imports.
The containerized cargo arrives and leaves the
seaports either by rail or truck as single modes or
by intermodal truck-rail combination.</p>

<p>Overall U.S. international maritime container traffic
more than doubled between 1995 and 2008 (<a href="figure_09.html">figure 9</a>). In 2008, about 28 million TEUs of U.S. international
oceanborne trade moved through U.S.
container ports, up from 13 million in 1995 (JOC
PIERS 2009b). As the rebound after the low year
in 2001 suggests, long-term growth is likely to resume
after the U.S. and global economies recover
from the current worldwide economic downturn.</p>

<p>In 2008, U.S. container ports handled a daily
average of 77,000 TEUs, up from 37,000 TEUs
per day in 1995. This large number of containers
moving through the nation's seaports highlights
the significance of container traffic and its potential
impacts on the economy, local communities,
national security, and the natural environment. It
also underscores the challenges of handling this
cargo efficiently, alleviating highway congestion
around the seaports, improving landside access to
ports, and removing freight bottlenecks at intermodal
transfer locations where trucks and railroads
connect to marine terminals.</p>

<p>A major factor affecting landside access to U.S.
container ports is the continuing growth of containerization.
Growth in containerization is directly
related to the provision of adequate intermodal
capacity to handle the associated increase in the
level of landside traffic. For example, on a typical
day in 2008, container throughput for the New
York/New Jersey port, the nation's third largest
container port, was 5,265,053 TEUs (PANYNJ
2009). Assuming a typical line-haul truck<sup> <a href="#ftnt_6">6</a></sup> carries
an equivalent of two TEUs, this annual throughput
translates into 2,632,526 one-way truck trips per
year. This is equivalent to 10,125 truck trips each
weekday resulting from containerized cargo. At
approximately 40 feet per trailer, on a typical work
day the trailers would stretch about 77 miles if
lined up end to end.</p>

<h3>PORT CONCENTRATION</h3>

<p>The geographic distribution of container activity
among U.S. seaports shows a greater concentration
of vessel calls and cargo traffic in a few
leading ports because of increased demand for
larger, faster, and more specialized vessels. Today,
maxi-Panamax superfreighter vessels are much
longer than two football fields and can carry up to
12,500 TEUs.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2008, the top 10 U.S. container ports accounted
for 86 percent of containerized imports and exports
(measured in TEUs), up from 78 percent in 1995.
Five of the top 10 container ports in the United
States are on the west coast, four are on the east
coast, and one on the gulf coast (<a href="table_03.html">table 3</a>).</p>

<p>From 1995 to 2008, Los Angeles and Long Beach
grew the most in terms of absolute level of container
traffic, reflecting increased U.S. trade with
Pacific Rim<sup> <a href="#ftnt_8">8</a></sup> countries, particularly China, and
the transportation of higher-value per ton Asian
manufactured goods into the United States. New
York followed closely, showing significant growth
in U.S. trade with Europe. The ports of Savannah,
Los Angeles, and Houston had the largest average
annual growth rates (table 3). The growth rates for
Savannah and Houston reflect the expansion in
U.S. container trade with Latin American countries
and changes in the location of freight logistics and
distribution service centers.</p>

<p>Despite the national economic slowdown, container
cargo handled by the Port of Savannah grew
4 percent in 2008 over 2007, the fastest growth
among the leading container ports. Between 1995
and 2005, oceanborne containerized cargo handled
there increased by 13 percent, making it the
fastest growing port in the nation. This growth in
Savannah's containerized traffic also underscores
the increase in retail import distribution centers
in the Savannah area-several national retailers
have established large distribution centers there
for handling the thousands of TEUs transiting the
nation's seaports.</p>

<h3>REGIONAL SHIFTS IN PORT MARKET SHARE</h3>
<p>The increased use of oceanborne containers in
transporting U.S. international trade continues
to affect port operations and the distribution of
total maritime trade among U.S. ports. Before the
mid-1980s, when U.S. trade with Pacific Rim Asian
countries was modest, east coast ports handled
the majority of U.S. international maritime trade. As
trade with Asia grew, the east coast ports' share of
the value of trade declined and west coast ports'
share increased (<a href="figure_10.html">figure 10</a>). 
Eventually, west coast
ports surpassed east coast ports in maritime cargo
handled, and this trend has continued to today.
Also during this period, changes in industrial activity
in the Midwest affected the volume and type
of cargo moving through Great Lakes ports. For
example, the relocation of final automobile assembly
plants and companies that produce auto parts
had an impact on manufacturing activities in the
Midwest. With the emergence of automakers and
parts producers in other parts of the United States,
maritime cargo originating in the Midwest and
cargo transport via the Great Lakes dwindled. Gulf
of Mexico ports experienced a modest increase
in their relative share as trade with Latin America
grew.</p>

<p>Over half of U.S. containerized merchandise trade,
measured in terms of TEUs, passes through west
coast ports. In 2007, 55 percent of the containerized 
imports and exports passed through these
ports, up from 42 percent in 1980 (figure 10). West
coast ports as a region grew the fastest during this
period (<a href="figure_11.html">figure 11</a>).</p>

<p>Although west coast ports handled the most
container trade, they also had a larger share of the
oceanborne containerized trade deficit, in terms of
export-import balance, than other regional ports.
Today, west coast ports serve more as import gateways
to the United States than as export gateways
to the rest of the world. In contrast, east coast
ports handle more exports than imports, despite
the decline in their regional market share.</p>

<p>Container trade also affects the pattern of freight
movement within the United States. Nearly all U.S.
oceanborne container trade is transported throughout
the country by either rail carriers, long-haul
truck carriers, or local truck carriers. Some ports
use short-sea shipping as an alternative to transport
goods shorter distances.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_9">9</a></sup> The availability and
efficiency of intermodal transportation in moving
these goods to and from any U.S. port increases
shippers' choices of transportation modes and
port facilities, allowing ports to effectively use their
economies of scale to attract cargo from beyond
their immediate region. The growth in U.S. containerized
cargo shipping is placing pressure on the
nation's transportation network and affects local
traffic congestion and delays in the urban areas
surrounding the major U.S. container ports. (See
<a href="spotlight_01.html">Spotlight 1</a> on landside access to the seaports.)</p>

<h3>VESSEL CALLS AND CAPACITY</h3>

<p>During the past two decades, the concentration
of maritime container vessel calls at U.S. ports
has shifted as the volume of containerized cargo
handled by the ports has changed. In 2007,
there were nearly 20,000 containership calls at
U.S. seaports, accounting for 31 percent of the
total oceangoing vessel calls made by all vessel
types at U.S. ports.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_10">10</a></sup> The top five container ports
handled over half (57 percent) of these container
vessel calls and 63 percent of the container cargo
capacity (<a href="table_04.html">table 4</a>). Just 2 years before, in 2005, the
top five ports handled 55 percent of the calls and
61 percent of the capacity.</p>

<p>Between 2002 and 2007, the number of vessel
calls at U.S. container ports rose 16 percent, from
about 17,100 to 19,800 calls. By contrast, total
vessel calls grew by 13 percent, from 56,600 to
63,800 calls.</p>

<p>Measured by the average vessel size per call,
U.S. maritime ports also handled larger container
vessels than in the past. The average size (per
call) of container vessels calling at U.S. ports was
nearly 48,000 deadweight tons (dwt) in 2007 (table
4). This is a significant increase from 38,000 dwt in
2000. Increases in vessel calls and containership
capacity affect port operation, port productivity,
and infrastructure requirements needed to accommodate
the mega post-Panamax vessels.
They also affect environmental considerations
and community-impact issues. (See <a href="spotlight_03.html">Spotlight 3</a> on
ports and environmental concerns.)</p>

<h3>RANKING OF U.S. PORTS AMONG WORLD&rsquo;S TOP PORTS</h3>

<p>In 2008, only 3 U.S. ports-Los Angeles, Long
Beach, and New York/New Jersey-ranked among
the world's top 20 container ports when measured
by TEUs, placing 16th, 17th, and 20th, respectively
(<a href="table_05.html">table 5</a>). Since 2000, these 3 U.S. ports have
dropped in the ranking of the world's top 20 ports
as European and Southeast Asian ports handled
more containerized cargo. During the same period,
Chinese seaports became more dominant, and
today 6 of the top 10 world ports are in China.
<a href="figure_12.html">Figure 12</a> shows the locations of the top 20 world
container ports in 2008, the 2008 ranking by TEUs
of cargo handled, and the cargo increases since
2000.</p>

<h3>TRADING PARTNERS</h3>

<p>While the United States exports and imports maritime
goods from more than 175 countries, the vast
majority of the trade is with relatively few countries.
In 2007, nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of the
container import TEUs were with 10 countries, and
over half (55 percent) of the container export TEUs
were with 10 countries. The top five overall U.S.
containerized cargo trading partners in 2007 were
all Asian countries: China (mainland),<sup> <a href="#ftnt_11">11</a></sup> Japan,
Hong Kong (China), South Korea, and Taiwan.
China (mainland) was the leading containerized
merchandise trading partner, accounting for 47
percent of U.S. maritime import TEUs, up from 25
percent in 2000. China accounted for 18 percent of
the export TEUs in 2007, down slightly from 2005
(<a href="figure_13.html">figure 13</a> and <a href="figure_14.html">figure 14</a>).</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2007, while China's share grew
of total U.S. container trade, the other top five
trading partners saw declines in their total maritime
containerized cargo with the United States. Japan
is now the second largest trading partner for U.S.
oceanborne containerized exports, having been
overtaken by China in 2003. In 2007, the U.S.
maritime container imports from China alone were
larger than those from more than 170 countries
combined (i.e., those countries grouped into "other"
(figure 13)).</p>

<p>U.S. imports and exports with major trading partners
vary by types of goods, and this affects the
types of vessels (for example, container, dry bulk,
general cargo, or tanker), number of port calls, and
the seaports the vessels use. For instance, while
most U.S.-Canada maritime trade involves agricultural
products, lumber, and petroleum products,
most U.S.-Germany maritime trade involves
manufactured products such as automobiles and
machinery. In addition, U.S. maritime imports from
Japan were valued at over $7,000 per ton, but
U.S. exports to Japan were valued at $800 per ton,
reflecting differences in the types of goods and the
growth in high-value containerized imports to U.S.
ports. Major U.S. maritime imports from Japan
include passenger cars, car parts, and electronic
equipment, and major U.S. maritime exports to
Japan include agricultural products, industrial
machinery, and chemicals.</p>

<h3>ENTRIES OF OCEANBORNE CONTAINER UNITS</h3>

<p>The container entries data from U.S. Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) represented in this
section and the next and in <a href="figure_15.html">figure 15</a> and <a href="figure_16.html">figure 16</a> are
different from the TEU data presented earlier in
the report. The CBP entries data count individual
container units, while the TEU data refer to 20-foot
equivalent units (that is, one 20-foot container
equals one TEU, and one 40-foot container equals
two TEUs). Because containers come in different
lengths (for example, 20 feet, 40 feet, and 48 feet),
the CBP figures on individual units differ from the
TEU figures, which convert the tonnage of goods
moved in the containers into TEUs.</p>

<p>The challenge of handling large volumes of containerized
imports from U.S. trading partners can
also be seen in the number of individual container
entries processed by CBP. After a slight decline in
the number of oceanborne containers entering the
United States in the aftermath of the September
11, 2001, attacks, the nation's seaports again
began handling an increasing number of container
units. In 2007, there were about 12 million oceanborne
container entries into the United States,
down slightly from 2006 but still double those of
2000 (figure 15). Maritime container entries peak in
the summer months, when imported merchandise
trade is delivered for the fall and holiday seasons
(figure 16).</p>

<h3>CONTAINER ENTRIES BY ALL MODES FROM ALL COUNTRIES</h3>

<p>On a typical day in 2007, more than 70,000
individual container units entered the United States
by ocean vessel, truck, and rail. In 2000, the figure
was about 50,000 units per day.</p>

<p>Overall, there were over 25 million container
entries into the United States by all modes of
transportation in 2007, up 38 percent from nearly
19 million in 2000. In addition to the more than 11
million oceanborne containers used to bring goods
into the United States, over 14 million containers
entered the nation by truck and rail from Canada
and Mexico in 2007 (<a href="table_06.html">table 6</a>). The large number of
containers crossing by land border into the United
States by surface modes reflects the importance
of U.S. trade with two of our top three trading
partners. From 2000 to 2007, the number of truck,
rail, and maritime container units (loaded and unloaded)
crossing into the United States rose by 8
percent, 27 percent, and 94 percent, respectively.</p>
