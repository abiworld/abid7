Repositioning of Empty Containers</h3>
<p>A broad challenge facing the U.S. maritime industry is the
repositioning of empty containers after they have been emptied of
the goods they transported to the United States. During the past
20 years, as merchandise trade between the United States and
its trading partners-particularly Asia-Pacific Rim countries-
mushroomed and the trade imbalance grew, the number of empty
containers idling in the United States increased. In general, the
larger the trade imbalance, the greater the need to reposition
empty containers for shippers to use for exports.</p>

<p>Although containers are designed to be reused (with new cargo
loaded for a new location soon after the original cargo is off-loaded),
in many cases the cost of transporting an empty container to
a place where it can be reloaded is higher than the container is
worth, particularly when empty containers must be transported
from inland locations to U.S. shippers or overseas.</p>

<p>In 1997, the difference between TEUs of U.S. containerized
imports and exports was about 715,000. By 2006, the difference
had reached a record high of nearly 10 million TEUs. In 2008,
it was about 6 million TEUs. These large numbers illustrate the
magnitude of the challenge of handling idle containers.</p>

<p>Empty containers are stored near seaports and inland intermodal
transfer locations. Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York/New
Jersey are the three largest port markets where leasing companies
and shipping lines store empty containers, and Chicago, Dallas,
and Memphis are notable storage locations for empty containers
inland (Mongelluzzo 2008). In 2008, the nation's top container
port, the Port of Los Angeles, handled about 1.9 million TEUs of
empty export containers, accounting for 51 percent of the total
outbound export TEUs for the port.</p>
