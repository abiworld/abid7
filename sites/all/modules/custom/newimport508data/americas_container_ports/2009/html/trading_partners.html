<h2 style="display:none">Trading Partners</h2>

<p>While the United States exports and imports maritime
goods from more than 175 countries, the vast
majority of the trade is with relatively few countries.
In 2007, nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of the
container import TEUs were with 10 countries, and
over half (55 percent) of the container export TEUs
were with 10 countries. The top five overall U.S.
containerized cargo trading partners in 2007 were
all Asian countries: China (mainland),<sup> <a href="#ftnt_11">11</a></sup> Japan,
Hong Kong (China), South Korea, and Taiwan.
China (mainland) was the leading containerized
merchandise trading partner, accounting for 47
percent of U.S. maritime import TEUs, up from 25
percent in 2000. China accounted for 18 percent of
the export TEUs in 2007, down slightly from 2005
(<a href="figure_13.html">figure 13</a> and <a href="figure_14.html">figure 14</a>).</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2007, while China's share grew
of total U.S. container trade, the other top five
trading partners saw declines in their total maritime
containerized cargo with the United States. Japan
is now the second largest trading partner for U.S.
oceanborne containerized exports, having been
overtaken by China in 2003. In 2007, the U.S.
maritime container imports from China alone were
larger than those from more than 170 countries
combined (i.e., those countries grouped into "other"
(figure 13)).</p>

<p>U.S. imports and exports with major trading partners
vary by types of goods, and this affects the
types of vessels (for example, container, dry bulk,
general cargo, or tanker), number of port calls, and
the seaports the vessels use. For instance, while
most U.S.-Canada maritime trade involves agricultural
products, lumber, and petroleum products,
most U.S.-Germany maritime trade involves
manufactured products such as automobiles and
machinery. In addition, U.S. maritime imports from
Japan were valued at over $7,000 per ton, but
U.S. exports to Japan were valued at $800 per ton,
reflecting differences in the types of goods and the
growth in high-value containerized imports to U.S.
ports. Major U.S. maritime imports from Japan
include passenger cars, car parts, and electronic
equipment, and major U.S. maritime exports to
Japan include agricultural products, industrial
machinery, and chemicals.</p>

mainland China and Hong Kong are considered separate. As
used here, China refers to mainland China.</p>
