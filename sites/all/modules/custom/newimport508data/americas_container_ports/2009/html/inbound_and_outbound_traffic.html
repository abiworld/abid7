<h2 style="display:none">Trends in Container Throughput</h2>
<p>While America's container seaports serve as
gateways for both merchandise imports and
exports, overall they handle more TEUs of imports
than exports. In 2008, the U.S. defi cit in maritime
container traffic-the gap between exports and
imports-narrowed to 6 million TEUs as maritime
container imports fell 8 percent and exports grew
6 percent (<a href="figure_07.html">figure 7</a>). This marked the second
year in a row that the deficit fell following record
high imports in 2006. In 2007 and 2008, although
the United States exported less abroad than it
imported, imports declined steeply because of the
economic slowdown at home. Exports grew
at a modest pace.</p>

<p>Before 1998, the defi cit of U.S. international
container traffic was less than 1 million
TEUs per year, but by 2008, this gap had
signifi cantly widened, with imports accounting
for a larger share of the total container
traffic (figure 7). In 2008, maritime container
imports passing through U.S. seaports
accounted for 61 percent of total container
traffic, a sizeable increase from 51 percent
in 1995. However, container exports
handled by the ports seem to be rebounding,
reaching 39 percent of total container
traffic in 2008, an increase from a low of 33
percent in 2005. A likely factor for the surge
in exports during 2007 and 2008 is the fall of
the U.S. dollar relative to the European euro
and other currencies. During this period, as
the dollar fell against the euro, American
goods became more affordable overseas.
This contributed to the rise in maritime
container exports. A stronger dollar provides
Americans with greater purchasing power
and results in more goods being imported,
while a weaker dollar leads to foreign buyers
purchasing more U.S. products.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_5">5</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="figure_08.html">Figure 8</a> shows the location of the nation's
top 25 maritime container ports for U.S.
international containerized exports and
imports in 2008. The top three container port
gateways were Los Angeles, Long Beach,
and New York/New Jersey. The containerized
exports and imports handled by these
leading ports serve the international trade needs
of every state, both coastal states with seaports as
well as landlocked states that depend on seaports
for their merchandise trade export and imports.
The containerized cargo arrives and leaves the
seaports either by rail or truck as single modes or
by intermodal truck-rail combination.</p>

<p>Overall U.S. international maritime container traffic
more than doubled between 1995 and 2008 (<a href="figure_09.html">figure 9</a>). In 2008, about 28 million TEUs of U.S. international
oceanborne trade moved through U.S.
container ports, up from 13 million in 1995 (JOC
PIERS 2009b). As the rebound after the low year
in 2001 suggests, long-term growth is likely to resume
after the U.S. and global economies recover
from the current worldwide economic downturn.</p>

<p>In 2008, U.S. container ports handled a daily
average of 77,000 TEUs, up from 37,000 TEUs
per day in 1995. This large number of containers
moving through the nation's seaports highlights
the significance of container traffic and its potential
impacts on the economy, local communities,
national security, and the natural environment. It
also underscores the challenges of handling this
cargo efficiently, alleviating highway congestion
around the seaports, improving landside access to
ports, and removing freight bottlenecks at intermodal
transfer locations where trucks and railroads
connect to marine terminals.</p>

<p>A major factor affecting landside access to U.S.
container ports is the continuing growth of containerization.
Growth in containerization is directly
related to the provision of adequate intermodal
capacity to handle the associated increase in the
level of landside traffic. For example, on a typical
day in 2008, container throughput for the New
York/New Jersey port, the nation's third largest
container port, was 5,265,053 TEUs (PANYNJ
2009). Assuming a typical line-haul truck<sup> <a href="#ftnt_6">6</a></sup> carries
an equivalent of two TEUs, this annual throughput
translates into 2,632,526 one-way truck trips per
year. This is equivalent to 10,125 truck trips each
weekday resulting from containerized cargo. At
approximately 40 feet per trailer, on a typical work
day the trailers would stretch about 77 miles if
lined up end to end.</p>


<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_5"></a><sup>5</sup> Because the merchandise trade deficit is more complicated
than simple changes in relative prices, a fall in the U.S. dollar
is not always effective in closing the gap between exports and
imports. Domestic recessions are often more effective in cutting
demand for imports and therefore reducing the trade balance.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_6"></a><sup>6</sup> A line-haul truck is usually a tractor-trailer combination of three
or more axles. A typical line-haul trailer is approximately 40 to
48 feet long and is permitted in most states to move a maximum
of 80,000 pounds gross weight.</p>
