<h2 style="display:none">Port Concentration</h2>
<p>The geographic distribution of container activity
among U.S. seaports shows a greater concentration
of vessel calls and cargo traffic in a few
leading ports because of increased demand for
larger, faster, and more specialized vessels. Today,
maxi-Panamax superfreighter vessels are much
longer than two football fields and can carry up to
12,500 TEUs.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2008, the top 10 U.S. container ports accounted
for 86 percent of containerized imports and exports
(measured in TEUs), up from 78 percent in 1995.
Five of the top 10 container ports in the United
States are on the west coast, four are on the east
coast, and one on the gulf coast (<a href="table_03.html">table 3</a>).</p>

<p>From 1995 to 2008, Los Angeles and Long Beach
grew the most in terms of absolute level of container
traffic, reflecting increased U.S. trade with
Pacific Rim<sup> <a href="#ftnt_8">8</a></sup> countries, particularly China, and
the transportation of higher-value per ton Asian
manufactured goods into the United States. New
York followed closely, showing significant growth
in U.S. trade with Europe. The ports of Savannah,
Los Angeles, and Houston had the largest average
annual growth rates (table 3). The growth rates for
Savannah and Houston reflect the expansion in
U.S. container trade with Latin American countries
and changes in the location of freight logistics and
distribution service centers.</p>

<p>Despite the national economic slowdown, container
cargo handled by the Port of Savannah grew
4 percent in 2008 over 2007, the fastest growth
among the leading container ports. Between 1995
and 2005, oceanborne containerized cargo handled
there increased by 13 percent, making it the
fastest growing port in the nation. This growth in
Savannah's containerized traffic also underscores
the increase in retail import distribution centers
in the Savannah area-several national retailers
have established large distribution centers there
for handling the thousands of TEUs transiting the
nation's seaports.</p>


<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_7"></a><sup>7</sup> These vessels are twice as large as the post-Panamax vessels.
Post-Panamax vessels are too large to pass through the
Panama Canal. They can carry up to 6,500 TEUs. They typically
have widths exceeding 32.2 meters (105.6 feet). Recent
designs of these vessels are able to carry more than 12,000
TEUs. The world's largest container vessel, Emma Maersk,
commissioned in 2006, is officially listed as an 11,000 TEU
ship, but its cargo capacity is estimated to range from 13,000
to 15,000 TEUs (<a href="http://about.maersk.com/en/Fleet/Pages/Fleet.aspx" title="You are leaving DOT">http://about.maersk.com/en/Fleet/Pages/Fleet.aspx</a>).</p>

Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South
Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and various Pacific islands.</p>
