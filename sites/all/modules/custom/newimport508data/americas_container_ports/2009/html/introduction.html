<h2 style="display:none">Introduction</h2>

<p>America's container ports play an important role in handling U.S. merchandise trade
moving to and from distant places around the world. Each year, these seaports
handle exports produced at U.S. factories and farms and imports of goods such as automobiles,
machinery, electronics, apparel, shoes, toys, and food. American households
depend on the nation's container seaports for everyday items, and American businesses
depend on these seaports for facilitating the exchange of merchandise with trading
partners around the world.</p>

<p>During 2008, the volume of maritime freight handled by America's container ports
dropped. U.S. international merchandise trade transported by maritime container vessels
fell sharply toward the end of the year, a decline that continued into 2009. Total U.S.
containerized freight for December 2008 was down 18 percent compared with December
2007 (<a href="table_01.html">table 1</a>). Maritime containerized imports declined 15 percent, and exports fell by
21 percent (JOC PIERS 2009a). This happened as U.S. businesses cut inventories,
manufacturing and construction activities stalled, and Americans cut back on spending as
unemployment rose, home values fell, and investment portfolios shrank.</p>

<p>The year 2008 was exceptionally challenging for the nation's leading container seaports.
After a steady pace at the beginning of the year, by end of 2008, containerized freight
throughput declined for each of the leading ports in the Pacific/west coast, Atlantic/east
coast, and gulf coast regions (table 1). All the major ports saw a decline in December
2008 compared with the same month in the previous year. The nation's two leading container
ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, experienced 13 and 25 percent year-on-year
drops, respectively. Other leading ports saw worse declines in container traffic, with cargo
falling by more than one-third to almost one-half-for example, Seattle fell 38 percent and
Mobile fell 49 percent.</p>

<p>By the end of 2008, U.S. total maritime container traffic at all U.S. ports was estimated at
28.2 million TEUs (see box), a 3 percent drop from the 29 million TEUs in 2007 (table 1).
During 2008, west coast ports had a 5 percent decline in container traffic and gulf coast
ports had a 3 percent decline. East coast ports had a 0.2 percent, or essentially negligible,
increase. Among the nation's top 10 leading container ports, 7 saw declines in their
container cargo throughput in 2008. The two largest declines were Seattle at 16 percent
and Long Beach at 8 percent (table 1 and <a href="figure_01.html">figure 1</a>). Only 3 of the top 10 ports, all on the
east coast, handled slightly more container cargo in 2008 than in 2007-Savannah grew
by 3.6 percent, New York/New Jersey by 1.4 percent, and Norfolk by 1.2 percent. These
east coast ports tend to have a more diversified trade market with Europe, Asia, Latin
America, and South America, unlike the west coast ports, which trade almost exclusively
with the Asia-Pacific market.</p>

  <td class="textbox"><p><b>TEU Defined</b>:</p>
<p>The standard measure for counting
containers is the 20-foot equivalent
unit, or TEU. This measure is used to
count containers of various lengths. A
standard 40-foot container is 2 TEUs,
and a 48-foot container equals 2.4
TEUs. It is also used to describe the
capacities of containerships or ports.</p></td>

<p>Containerized trade between the United
States and the rest of the world fell in 2008
because of the combined influence of
weak domestic consumer demand, which
cut import levels, and the global economic
slowdown, which cut foreign demand for
U.S. exports. During the second half of 2008,
as the U.S. financial crisis began to directly
impact consumer spending, Americans cut
back on their purchase of imported clothes,
automobiles, and other consumer merchandise,
such as toys and flat-panel televisions.
In addition, as the domestic financial crisis deepened and the global recession widened,
overseas trading partners' demand for U.S. goods started to tumble, further weakening
the maritime container market. As a result, declines
occurred in U.S. demand for maritime container
transportation by ocean vessels, cargo-handling
activity at the container ports, and the volume of
intermodal freight moved to and from the ports by
truck and rail.</p>

<p>The declines in maritime container traffic mirrored
the slide in overall U.S. international merchandise
exports and imports transported by all modes of
transportation in 2007 and 2008 and followed the
trend in the national economy as a whole (<a href="figure_02.html">figure
2</a> and <a href="figure_03.html">figure 3</a>). According to the U.S. Department
of Commerce, the primary contributors to the
declines in merchandise exports and imports in the
fourth quarter of 2008 were industrial supplies and
materials; automotive vehicles, parts, and engines;
consumer goods; and foods, feeds, and beverages
(USDOC CB BEA 2009). When adjusted for inflation,
the value of merchandise exports in the fourth
quarter of 2008 dropped 34 percent compared with
that of the third quarter. The value of merchandise
imports dropped 19 percent (figure 3).</p>

<p>Trends in container shipping are directly related
to patterns in overall international trade, which is
a primary contributing factor in the nation's economic
growth. For example, real gross domestic
product (GDP)-the output of goods and services
produced by labor and property located in the
United States-decreased at an annual rate of
6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 (i.e., from
the third quarter to the fourth quarter). In the third
quarter, real GDP decreased 0.5 percent (USDOC
BEA 2009). The slowdown in real GDP primarily
refl ected a sharp decline in personal consumption
expenditure, the downturn in exports and
imports, and a decline in state and local government
spending.</p>

<p>Declines in economic activity and drops in exports
and imports result in reduced demand for freight
transportation services by all modes of transportation.
However, because the majority of U.S.
overseas merchandise trade (over 66 percent by
value and 99 percent by weight) moves by ocean
vessel (USDOC CB 2009), the nation's container
ports felt the crunch immediately, but the effects
were not limited to the seaports.<sup> <a href="#ftnt_1">1</a></sup></p>

trade with Canada and Mexico.</p>
