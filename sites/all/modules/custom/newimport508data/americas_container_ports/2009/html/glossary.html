<p><b>All hazards incident</b>. Refers to any incident, the
result of terrorism or a natural disaster, that could
affect the maritime transportation system.</p>
<p><b>Ballast water</b>. Fresh or salt water, sometimes
containing sediments, held in tanks and cargo
holds of ships to increase stability and maneuverability
during transit.</p>
<p><b>Break-bulk</b>. Packages of maritime cargo that
are handled individually, palletized, or unitized
for purposes of transportation as opposed to bulk
and containerized freight.</p>
<p><b>Bulk carrier</b>. A ship with specialized holds for
carrying dry or liquid commodities, such as oil,
grain, ore, and coal, in unpackaged bulk form.
Bulk carriers may be designed to carry a single
bulk product (crude oil tanker) or accommodate
several bulk product types (ore/bulk/oil carrier)
on the same voyage or on a subsequent voyage
after holds are cleaned.</p>
<p><b>Chained dollars</b>. A measure used to express
real prices, defined as prices that are adjusted to
remove the effect of changes in the purchasing
power of the dollar. Real prices usually reflect
buying power relative to a reference year. The
"chained-dollar" measure is based on the average
weights of goods and services in successive
pairs of years. It is "chained" because the second
year in each pair, with its weights, becomes the
first year of the next pair. Before 1996, real prices
were expressed in constant dollars, a weighted
measure of goods and services in a single year.
See also <i>current dollars</i>.</p>
<p><b>Class I freight railroad</b>. Defined by the American
Association of Railroads each year based on
annual operating revenue. For 2008, the threshold
for Class I railroads was revenues exceeding
$360 million. A railroad is dropped from the Class
I list if it fails to meet the annual revenue threshold
for three consecutive years.</p>
<p><b>Container</b>. A large standard-size metal box
into which cargo is packed for shipment aboard
specially configured oceangoing containerships.
It is designed to be moved with common handling
equipment to enable high-speed intermodal
transfers in economically large units between
ships, railcars, truck chassis, and barges using a
minimum of labor. Therefore, the container rather
than the cargo in it serves as the transfer unit.</p>
<p><b>Containerization</b>. A system of intermodal freight
transportation that uses standard containers that
can be loaded onto vessels, railcars, and trucks.
It involves the stowage of general or special
cargo in a container for transport in the various
modes.</p>
<p><b>Containership</b>. A cargo vessel designed and
constructed to transport, within specifically
designed cells, portable tanks and freight containers,
which are lifted on and off with their contents
intact.</p>
<p><b>Containerized cargo</b>: Cargo that is practical to
transport in a container and results in a more
economical shipment than could be achieved by
shipping the cargo in some other form of unitization
(e.g., break-bulk).</p>
<p><b>Container terminal</b>. An area designated for
the stowage of cargo in containers. It is usually
accessible by truck, railroad, and marine transportation.
At a container terminal, containers are
picked up, dropped off, maintained, and housed.</p>
<p><b>Container throughput</b>. A measure of the number
of containers handled over a period of time. It
is a standard measure for the productivity of a
seaport. Container throughput is measured by
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).</p>
<p><b>Current dollars</b>. Dollar value of a good or service
in terms of prices current at the time the good or
service is sold. See also <i>chained dollars</i>.</p>
<p><b>Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
(C-TPAT)</b>. A voluntary public-private partnership
program in which the private owners of supply
chain infrastructure and cargo work with U.S.
Customs and Border Protection to improve the
security of the international supply chain. See
<a href="http://www.cbp.gov" title="You are leaving DOT">www.cbp.gov</a> for details.</p>
<p><b>Deadweight tons (dwt)</b>. The total weight of a
ship's load, including cargo, fuel, and crew. The
deadweight tonnage of a ship is the difference
between its weight when completely empty and its
weight when fully loaded.</p>
<p><b>Gross domestic product (GDP)</b>. The total value
of goods and services produced by labor and property
located in the United States. As long as the
labor and property are located in the United States,
the supplier (the workers and, for property, the
owners) may be either U.S. residents or residents
of foreign countries.</p>
<p><b>Highway-rail crossing</b>. A location where one or
more railroad tracks intersect a public or private
thoroughfare, a sidewalk, or a pathway.</p>
<p><b>Intermodal container</b>. A freight container designed
to permit it to be used interchangeably in two or
more modes of transport.</p>
<p><b>Intermodal</b>. Used to denote movements of cargo
containers interchangeably between transport
modes-i.e., motor, water, and air carriers-and
where the equipment is compatible within the
multiple systems.</p>
<p><b>Just in time (JIT)</b>. A method of inventory control
in which warehousing is minimal or nonexistent.
A container is the movable warehouse and must
arrive "just in time," not too early or too late.</p>
<p><b>Marine terminal</b>. A designated area of a port
used for the transmission, care, and convenience
of cargo and/or passengers in the interchange of
them between land and water carriers or between
two water carriers. It includes wharves, warehouses,
covered and/or open storage spaces, cold
storage plants, grain elevators and/or bulk cargo
loading and/or unloading structures, landings, and
receiving stations.</p>
<p><b>Marine Transportation System (MTS)</b>. Consists
of all the intermodal components that are part of
the maritime domain, including ships, ports, inland
waterways, intermodal rail and truck, and other
users of the maritime system.</p>
<p><b>Merchandise trade exports</b>. Merchandise transported
out of the United States to foreign countries
whether such merchandise is exported from
within the U.S. Customs Service territory, from a
U.S. Customs bonded warehouse, or from a U.S.
Foreign Trade Zone. (Foreign Trade Zones are
areas, operated as public utilities, under the control
of U.S. Customs with facilities for handling, storing,
manipulating, manufacturing, and exhibiting
goods.)</p>
<p><b>Merchandise trade imports</b>. Commodities of
foreign origin entering the United States, as well
as goods of domestic origin returned to the United
States with no change in condition or after having
been processed and/or assembled in other countries.
Puerto Rico is a customs district within the
U.S. Customs territory, and its trade with foreign
countries is included in U.S. import statistics. U.S.
import statistics also include merchandise trade between
the U.S. Virgin Islands and foreign countries
even though the islands are not officially a part of
the U.S. Customs territory.</p>
<p><b>Port</b>. A harbor area in which marine terminal facilities
for transferring cargo between ships and land
transportation are located.</p>
<p><b>Real gross domestic product (GDP)</b>. The real
counterpart to current/nominal GDP, obtained
by valuing output in a given year at prices from
another year, called the base year. It reflects
correction for inflation and changes in the price of
goods and services.</p>
<p><b>Roll-on/roll-off vessel</b>. Ships that are designed to
carry wheeled containers or other wheeled cargo
and that use the roll-on/roll-off method for loading
and unloading.</p>
<p><b>Secure Freight Initiative (SFI)</b>. A joint program
of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and
the U.S. Department of Energy that is designed
to scan U.S.-bound containers for nuclear or
radiological materials at their foreign ports of origin.

<p><b>Tanker</b>. An oceangoing ship designed to haul liquid
bulk cargo in world trade.</p>
<p><b>Twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU)</b>. The standard
unit for measuring the volume of containers that
seaports handle. Standard container sizes are 20
feet, 40 feet, and 48 feet long.</p>
<p><b>Virtual container yard</b>. Virtual container yards
are Web-based platforms where users can match
empty containers to container needs at the dock
rather than returning them to the terminal.</p>
