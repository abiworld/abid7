<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: To compare economic changes over time, current or nominal values of currencies are adjusted for inflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis establishes indices to calculate changes between years. These are used to calculate real chained dollars. Annual changes in the indices are chained (multiplied) together to form a time series. Chained dollars, instead of merely reflecting inflation, capture the effect of relative changes in prices and in the composition of output. They also better reflect cyclical fluctuations in the economy.</p>
