<h2 style="display:none">Ranking of U.S. Ports Among World's Top Ports</h2>

<p>In 2008, only 3 U.S. ports-Los Angeles, Long
Beach, and New York/New Jersey-ranked among
the world's top 20 container ports when measured
by TEUs, placing 16th, 17th, and 20th, respectively
(<a href="table_05.html">table 5</a>). Since 2000, these 3 U.S. ports have
dropped in the ranking of the world's top 20 ports
as European and Southeast Asian ports handled
more containerized cargo. During the same period,
Chinese seaports became more dominant, and
today 6 of the top 10 world ports are in China.
<a href="figure_12.html">Figure 12</a> shows the locations of the top 20 world
container ports in 2008, the 2008 ranking by TEUs
of cargo handled, and the cargo increases since
2000.</p>
