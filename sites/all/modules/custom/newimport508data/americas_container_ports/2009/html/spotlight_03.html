<h2 style="display:none">Spotlight 3: Ports and Environmental Concerns</h2>

<p>Oceanborne container activities at U.S. seaports, while essential for trade and commerce, can affect
water quality, air quality, and land-use patterns. The complex interconnections between port activities
and environmental quality have implications for the nation's coastal, ocean, and freshwater
resources. They also affect transportation demands and traffic congestion. U.S. ports have recently
renewed their attention to environmental concerns. In particular, port and federal agencies with
responsibility for marine environmental quality have focused on the following issues:</p>

	<ul class="btsfont">

		<li>Water quality. The greater use of larger shipping vessels and increased portside traffic escalate
the risk both of introducing nonindigenous aquatic species through ballast water<sup> <a href="#ftnt_16">16</a></sup> and of
leaking of toxic materials into marine ecosystems. They also increase demand for dredging of
sediments in ports and harbors.</li>
		<li>Air quality. Increased container activity and the accompanying growth in truck and cargohandling
equipment operating at U.S. ports generate additional air pollutants, including carbon
monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Port activities can
also result in noise pollution.</li>
		<li>Land-use patterns. Increased containership traffic and activity at ports adds to traffic congestion
around the ports, affecting landside access. Because port traffic intermingles with residential
and commercial traffic in the adjacent land areas, growth in container traffic results in increasing
congestion for both freight carriers and private citizens. </li>    
    
    </ul>



<p>U.S. ports are also considering the potential environmental challenges implicit in climate change,
including costs of improved infrastructure to protect harbors from rising sea levels, increased port
maintenance costs, and increased operations costs due to delays in shipping activities (EPA 2008b).</p>

<p>To deal with these challenges, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has introduced
new environmental and sustainability initiatives. EPA's initiative to reduce diesel emissions at
U.S. ports, called Clean Ports USA, suggests a variety of operational and technological ideas that
ports can adapt to their individual needs, including truck idle reduction, the use of cleaner fuel, and
replacement of older equipment (EPA 2005). EPA has also developed an overarching strategy for
sustainable ports that provides measures that ports can implement, largely voluntarily, in partnership
with the agency. Focus areas include clean air and affordable energy, clean and safe water,
healthy communities and ecosystems, the global environment, ports communication, and enforcement
(EPA 2007).</p>

<p>By 2008, more than 18 U.S. ports were developing and using Environmental Management Systems
(EMS), which integrate environmental considerations in both day-to-day operational decisions and
long-term planning (EPA 2008a). Many U.S. ports have also launched their own "green" initiatives.
For example, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have received national attention for
environmental efforts focused on air quality. With help from California state and local air-quality
agencies, for example, they are using cleaner fuels and replacing older trucks with hybrid vehicles,
including the world's first hybrid tugboat (Murr 2008).</p>


<p class="note"><a name="ftnt_16"></a><sup>16</sup> Ballast water is taken on empty ships to stabalize the ship. When a ship is loaded with cargo, the ballast water is
pumped out, introducing aquatic organisms from its origin port at its destination.</p>
