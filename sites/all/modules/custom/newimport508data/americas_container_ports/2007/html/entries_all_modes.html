<h2 style="display:none">Container Entries by All Modes from All Countries </h2>

<p>Overall, there were nearly 26 million container entries into the United States by all modes of transportation in 2005, up 37 percent from 19 million in 2000. In addition to the nearly 11 million oceanborne containers used to bring imports into the United States, over 15 million containers entered the nation by truck and rail from Canada and Mexico in 2005 (<a href="figure_06.html">figure 6</a>). The large number of containers crossing by land border into the United States by surface modes reflects the continued importance of overall U.S. trade with its top two trading partners, Canada and Mexico. From 2000 to 2005, the number of truck, rail, and maritime containers (full and empty) crossing into the United States rose by 10, 23, and 91 percent respectively.</p>
