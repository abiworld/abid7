<h2 style="display:none">Container Ports and Data Needs</h2>

<p>Comprehensive and comparable data for all modes of transportation, including intermodal transfer points, are necessary to present a complete picture of containerized cargo movements to, from, through, and within the United States. No single data source currently provides all the data needed for true multimodal and intermodal containerization research and analysis for all modes. The lack of data on commodity details for all containers and the lack of U.S. outbound border crossing information for container traffic by truck and rail pose a problem for analyzing the use and performance of the nation&rsquo;s ports and border infrastructure.</p>

<p>Also, with regards to analyzing container transportation trends, there is the lack of information on true origins and destinations of container shipments within the United States. This data gap limits analysis of major freight corridors to and from U.S. seaports and border gateways and affects our understanding of freight capacity, highway congestion, and traffic delays related to U.S.-international freight transportation.</p>
